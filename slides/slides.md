+ Q1: What should be our **chief aim** in this life?
+ A: To live in God's **fellowship**, <br/>
  enjoy His **favour**, <br/>
  and obtain eternal **happiness** thereafter.

>>>
+ First Q of the Elbing **catechism**
+ *"fellowship"*: close **relationship**
+ *"favour"*: implies **obedience**
+ *"happiness"*: but Q2 adds we still need to provide for needs of **body**

You shall **love** the Lord your God <br/>
with all your **heart** <br/>
and with all your **soul** <br/>
and with all your **mind**.

You shall **love** your **neighbour** as yourself.

<div class="ref">
Matthew 22:37,39 (ESV)
</div>

>>>
+ Love **God**, love your **neighbour**
+ But love **defined** by God, not us
+ in order to truly **love**:
  + need to **know** who God is

the **heavens** and the **earth**.

<div class="ref">

  + e.g., physical universe not **eternal**
+ Implies God **pre-existing**
  + un-created

+ **How** do we know God is the Creator?
  + God's **works** (nature, conscience)
  + God's **word** (Scripture) testify:

<span class="ref">8</span>
or speak to the **earth**, and it will teach you, <br/>
or let the **fish** in the sea inform you.

Which of all these does not **know** <br/>
that the **hand of the Lord** has done this?

<div class="ref">

For since the **creation** of the world

His **invisible** attributes,  <br/>
His eternal **power** and divine **nature**,

have been **clearly** seen, being understood <br/>
through what has been **made**,

so that they are **without excuse**.

>>>
+ **invisible** (unprovable) attribs:

+ &rArr; to say God doesn't **exist** is to
