[Paul] **witnessed** to them from morning till evening, <br/>
**explaining** about the kingdom of God

<div class="ref">
Acts 28:23 (NIV)

>>>
+ *"witness"* (ἐξετίθετο): **lay out** clearly
  + God's truth is center of bulls-eye
+ **sin** is anything **else**, deviate from truth
  + often more **interesting** to learn about **cults**
  + useful to keep us **grounded**
  + What if I **relax** this tenet of faith?
  + How do (JW, Mormons, Muslims, Sikh, Hindu, etc.) **deviate**?
+ but an **infinitude** of falsehoods
  + only **one** truth
+ Hence why **creeds** can be handy:

## Outline for today: Creation
1. God the **Creator**
  1. Revealed in His **Works**
  1. Revealed in His **Word**
1. God as **Trinity**
1. God's **Creation**
  1. Creation of **Man**
  1. Creation of **Angels**
1. God the **Sustainer**

---
In the **beginning** God created the **heavens** and the **earth**.

<div class="ref">
Genesis 1:1 (NIV)
</div>

>>>
+ Created **time** + **space**
  + e.g., physical universe not **eternal**
+ Implies God **pre-existing**
  + un-created

---
By **faith** we understand that <br/>
the **universe** was formed at God’s **command**, <br/>
so that what is **seen** <br/>
was not made out of what was **visible**.

<div class="ref">
Hebrews 11:3 (NIV)
</div>

>>>
+ *ex-nihilo*: out of **nothing**
+ not apprehendable solely via our **logic** / reason / science
  + requires **trust** in God's account
  + He is the only **eyewitness** to creation!
+ But is this **blind** faith? No, both
  + God's **works** (nature, conscience) and
  + God's **word** (Scripture) testify He is the Creator:

---
But ask the **animals**, and they will teach you, <br/>
or the **birds** in the sky, and they will tell you;

<span class="ref">8</span>
or speak to the **earth**, and it will teach you, <br/>
or let the **fish** in the sea inform you.

<span class="ref">9</span>
Which of all these does not **know** <br/>
that the **hand of the Lord** has done this?

<div class="ref">
Job 12:7-9 (NIV)
</div>

>>>
+ It is Biblical to study **science**!
  + zoology, ornithology, geology, marine biology
+ All these **point** to the Creator
+ Even our own **consciences** testify:

---
For since the **creation** of the world

His **invisible** attributes,  <br/>
His eternal **power** and divine **nature**,

have been **clearly** seen,  <br/>
being understood through what has been **made**,

so that they are **without excuse**.

<div class="ref">
Romans 1:20 (NASB)
</div>

>>>
+ God has **invisible** (unprovable) attributes:
  + beyond **time**, beyond **physical** world
+ But they are made **visible** through
  + **created** things, since beginning of **time**
+ v19 God is the one who made it **evident** (plain)
  + not vague and **unknowable** (e.g., *agnosticism*)
+ &rArr; to say God doesn't **exist** is
  + to **willfully** reject God's revealed evidence
  + &rArr; **onus** of proof is on **atheist**!
+ But what about God's **character**?
  + is He **cruel**, uncaring, selfish?

---
The LORD, the LORD God, **compassionate** and gracious, <br/>
**slow** to anger, and **abounding** in lovingkindness and truth;

<span class="ref">7</span>
who keeps **lovingkindness** for thousands, <br/>
who **forgives** iniquity, transgression and sin;

yet He will by no means leave the **guilty** unpunished

<div class="ref">
Exodus 34:6-7 (NASB)
</div>

>>>
+ cf **Greek** / Norse gods: *super-hero* mythology
  + merely **elevated men**
+ Nietzche's aspirational *"Übermensch"*
  + **self**-made improvement
  + rather than **external** God
+ thread: **justice** + **mercy**
+ But that's just one **interpretation**, right?
  + How can we know what the Bible really **means**?

---
But know this first of all, that no **prophecy** of Scripture <br/>
is a matter of one’s own **interpretation**,

<span class="ref">21</span>
for no prophecy was ever made by an act of **human will**, <br/>
but men **moved** by the Holy Spirit **spoke** from God.

<div class="ref">
2 Peter 1:20-21 (NASB)
</div>

>>>
+ **purpose** of Scripture is to make **known** God's will
  + not deliberately **obfuscated**
+ but sometimes our **brains** are not there yet
  + &rArr; need to **study** in more detail
+ or we our **spirits** unwilling to accept
  + &rArr; Spirit removes **veil** over heart *(2Cor3)*

<!-- .slide: data-background="white" -->
# Does **creation** matter?

>>>
+ What is my **view** on creation?
+ "Maybe God created the world, maybe not --
  + "it doesn't matter,
  + "I can still be a Christian, right?"

## Outline: Trinity

>>>
+ term "Trinity" not in Bible
  + Tertullian, 3rd c.: one in **essence** (ὁμοούσιος), not person
+ but Jesus did say:

---
Go therefore and make **disciples** of all the nations, <br/>
**baptizing** them in the name of  <br/>
the **Father** and the **Son** and the **Holy Spirit**

<div class="ref">
Matthew 28:19 (NASB)
</div>

>>>
+ not that Son was **created** or lesser
  + cf *Arianism* (&rArr; Nicene creed)
+ not **3 Gods**
  + cf **Islam**: reject Christ as God
+ but what are their particular **characteristics**?

---
May the **grace** of the Lord **Jesus** Christ, <br/>
and the **love** of **God**, <br/>
and the **fellowship** of the **Holy Spirit** <br/>
be with you all.

<div class="ref">
2 Corinthians 13:14 (NIV)
</div>

>>>
+ *Father*: **Creator**, judge, mercy: **love**
+ *Son*: **Redeemer**, high priest, sacrifice: **grace**
+ *HS*: **Comforter**, presence, unity: **fellowship**
