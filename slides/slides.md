  + often more **interesting** to learn about **cults**
  + useful to keep us **grounded**
  + What if I **relax** this tenet of faith?

## Outline for today: Creation
1. God the **Creator**
  1. Revealed in His **Works**
  1. Revealed in His **Word**
1. God as **Trinity**
1. God's **Creation**
  1. Creation of **Man**
  1. Creation of **Angels**
1. God the **Sustainer**

---
In the **beginning** God created <br/>
the **heavens** and the **earth**.

<div class="ref">
Genesis 1:1 (NIV)
</div>

>>>
+ Created **time** + **space**
  + e.g., physical universe not **eternal**
+ Implies God **pre-existing**
  + un-created
+ **How** do we know God is the Creator?
  + God's **works** (nature, conscience) and
  + God's **word** (Scripture) testify:

---
But ask the **animals**, and they will teach you, <br/>
or the **birds** in the sky, and they will tell you;

<span class="ref">8</span>
or speak to the **earth**, and it will teach you, <br/>
or let the **fish** in the sea inform you.

<span class="ref">9</span>
Which of all these does not **know** <br/>
that the **hand of the Lord** has done this?

<div class="ref">
Job 12:7-9 (NIV)
</div>

>>>
+ It is Biblical to study **science**!
  + zoology, ornithology, geology, marine biology
+ All these **point** to the Creator
+ Even our own **consciences** testify:

---
For since the **creation** of the world

His **invisible** attributes,  <br/>
His eternal **power** and divine **nature**,

have been **clearly** seen, being understood <br/>
through what has been **made**,

so that they are **without excuse**.

<div class="ref">
Romans 1:20 (NASB)
</div>

>>>
+ God has **invisible** (unprovable) attributes:
  + beyond **time**, beyond **physical** world
+ But they are made **visible** through
  + **created** things, since beginning of **time**
+ v19 God is the one who made it **evident** (plain)
  + not vague and **unknowable** (e.g., *agnosticism*)
+ &rArr; to say God doesn't **exist** is
  + to **willfully** reject God's revealed evidence
  + &rArr; **onus** of proof is on **atheist**!
+ God's **works** reveal Him

+ But what about God's **character**?
  + is He **cruel**, uncaring, selfish?
+ What does **Scripture** testify?

---
The LORD, the LORD God, <br/>
**compassionate** and gracious, <br/>
**slow** to anger, <br/>
and **abounding** in lovingkindness and truth;

<span class="ref">7</span>
who keeps **lovingkindness** for thousands, <br/>
who **forgives** iniquity, transgression and sin;

yet He will by no means <br/>
leave the **guilty** unpunished

<div class="ref">
Exodus 34:6-7 (NASB)
</div>

>>>
+ cf **Greek** / Norse gods: *super-hero* mythology
  + merely **elevated men**
+ Nietzche's aspirational *"Übermensch"*
  + **self**-made improvement
  + rather than **external** God
+ thread: **justice** + **mercy**
+ But that's just one **interpretation**, right?
  + How can we know what the Bible really **means**?

---
But know this first of all, <br/>
that no **prophecy** of Scripture <br/>
is a matter of one’s own **interpretation**,

<span class="ref">21</span>
for no prophecy was ever made <br/>
by an act of **human will**,

but men **moved** by the Holy Spirit <br/>
**spoke** from God.

<div class="ref">
2 Peter 1:20-21 (NASB)
</div>

>>>
+ **purpose** of Scripture is to make **known** God's will
  + not deliberately **obfuscated**
+ but sometimes our **brains** are not there yet
  + &rArr; need to **study** in more detail
+ or we our **spirits** unwilling to accept
  + &rArr; Spirit removes **veil** over heart *(2Cor3)*
